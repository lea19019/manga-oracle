# Manga Oracle Overview
As a frequent manga reader I've come across into situations when a power/situation/event was described and later referenced in another chapter several months later. Or situations when something is explained but was hard to grasp, for example Hakari's domain expansion and cursed technique is hard to understand. 

This app is meant to work like a chatbot that you can feed with manga and will answer questions or explain things related to it.

The idea behind this project is to provide an educational experience in the development of AI powered applications and technologies I find interesting that I've been wanting to learn more about.
